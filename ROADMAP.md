# Phase 1

- Form core group of 'governors' until a proper DAO can be formed.
- Decide on foundational components of token - e.g. Issuance, Logo, Abbreviation
- Create ERC-20 Token (keep an eye on ERC-223 as well)
- Create a basic faucet mechanism to distribute tokens (ideally a Slack bot)
- Create a website with instructions on how to get tokens.

# Phase 2

- Allow user group leaders to distribute tokens to attendees.
- Establish governance procedures (how to vote, who gets to vote, etc...)
- Enhanced Slack bot abilities (tip/transfer tokens via slack)

# Phase 3

- Move all governance to blockchain/DAO - possibly via Aragon
- Establish benefits for token holders (free TechCamp tickets, raffles, voting rights, etc...) 
- Build exchange mechanism into website - possibly with _0x_ protocol.
